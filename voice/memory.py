"""InMoov long-term memory.

Three stores, all plain files under voice/memory/ so they survive restarts
and can be read or edited by hand:

  facts.json        things InMoov learned about the user / the world
  transcript.jsonl  every exchange, append-only (the raw record)
  phrases.json      sentences users actually say, with how often

Retrieval is deliberately keyword-based, not embeddings: it costs about a
millisecond, needs no extra model in VRAM, and for a few thousand short
facts it is accurate enough. Swap in embeddings later if the store grows.
